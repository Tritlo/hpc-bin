# Haskell Program Coverage

This repository provides the `hpc` binary which produces coverage reports in various formats from .tix and .mix files.

## Documentation

The documentation of the `hpc-binary` is available online on readthedocs (TODO).
In order to build the documentation locally, you have to install the [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation generator on your machine, as well as the `sphinx_rtd_theme`, and invoke `make html` in the `docs/` subdirectory.
